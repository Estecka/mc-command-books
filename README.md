# Command books

Mod intended for creative or development. 
This is similar in spirit to using a chain of command blocks, but more portable and with easier setup.

## Usage

Write commands into a book-and-quill, one command per lines. 
To execute the commands, hold the book in your off-hand, and use a stick in your main hand.

All commands are run in succession, even if one fails along the way.
